## WELCOME:
This is the README.md for the Challenge ONE "first homework assignment" for the UT Coding Bootcamp.

Given source code was refractored and full functionality restored. 

## STRUCTURE:
The repo on GitHub has directories in the below structure:

```
/Ch1_HoriseonWebsite
|-README.md (you are here)
|-index.html
assets/
|-css/
images/
```

## HOW TO:
* Load index.html in your browser to view the client's refractored website.
* css/ contains 'reset.css' and 'style.css'
* 'reset.css' resets boundry-box so the website behaves nice on all browsers
* 'style.css' contains all the styling for index.html
* images/ contains all the .png and .jpg files necessary to display the website correctly.
